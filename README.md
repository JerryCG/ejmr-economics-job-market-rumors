# About ‚úåüèΩ

Hello world üåè! Are you an economist? Do you like being anonymous? Or are you fed up with such behaviors? If so, then this repository is for you!

# Warning! ‚ö†Ô∏è
Since this repository uses cron job from GitHub Actions to update the data, consequently the .git directory will eat up disk space. Hence, it is not advisable to clone this repository to your local machine. If you are interested to do something similar, just download this repository as a zipped file. You can do the following:

```bash
# download repository from main branch
wget https://github.com/ledwindra/ejmr-economics-job-market-rumors/archive/main.zip
```

This won't include the .git directory and you can play around with the programs and data inside your local machine.

# Plot examples

From the dataset, we can generate insights by making visualizations. Following are some examples:

#### 1. Bar plot

#### 2. Density plot

#### 3. Scatter plot

#### 4. Line plot

# Download data

```
ANNOUNCEMENT!

Due to the large files that exceed the limit imposed by GitHub, both stats-table and post files are separated into multiple files so that they have smaller sizes. To get the data, just download from the data/ directory
```

I try as much to make this repository convenient for any audience, even if you haven't programmed in Python before. So just chill and relax, because you can download the data without having to run the program by yourself. Enjoy! üåû ‚õ± ü•• üå¥ üòé.
